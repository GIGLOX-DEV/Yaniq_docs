### üîí Resilience Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implemented using Resilience4j (`@CircuitBreaker`) to protect services from cascading failures.
- **Retry & Timeout**: Configured to automatically retry failed requests and apply timeouts, enhancing system stability.
- **Bulkhead**: Service isolation through Bulkhead pattern, preventing resource exhaustion and improving fault tolerance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforced at the API Gateway level with Redis integration to control request rates and prevent abuse.
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management across Order, Payment, and Inventory services for data consistency.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation strategies to maintain user experience during service outages.
- **Health Checks**: Regular health monitoring of services using Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
- **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer for efficient request

### üìä Observability

- **Metrics**: Micrometer + Prometheus
- **Dashboards**: Grafana
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Logging**: Centralized ELK stack
- **Health Checks**: Actuator endpoints for service health monitoring
- **Alerting**: Prometheus Alertmanager for proactive incident management
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing across microservices for performance monitoring and debugging
